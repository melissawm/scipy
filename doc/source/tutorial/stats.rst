Introduction
------------

In this tutorial, we discuss many, but certainly not all, features of
``scipy.stats``. The intention here is to provide a user with a
working knowledge of this package. We refer to the
:ref:`reference manual <statsrefmanual>` for further details.

Note: This documentation is work in progress.
